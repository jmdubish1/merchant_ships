This is my first non-one off data science project. It was intended for me to experiment with living datasets/keeping an inventory as well as stress the goal of cleanly code

Begin the program by running game.py. Your trading ship will start at Tortoise Island. Type "check map" for a list of other ports in the area. Traveling to each port costs gold, but also the potential for new prices and items. Each port contains its own special prices for the different types of items, but which is which is not stated in the gameplay. Buy items that you think are on sale, then take them to another port to sell. Be careful of how much gold you have left though, a mutiny may be on your hands.

Open game.py and follow the initial instructions.
